# certbot-certificate-for-nginx

This guide suppose that we are alreay have nginx container (nginx_server) in docker-compose:

```
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: nginx_server
    volumes:
      - static_volume_app1:/usr/share/nginx/html/static_app1
      - media_volume_app1:/usr/share/nginx/html/media_app1
      - static_volume_app2:/usr/share/nginx/html/static_app2
      - media_volume_app2:/usr/share/nginx/html/media_app2
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
```

1. Add the following line in docker-compose file:

```
- /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

the nginx part of docker-compose file should look like this:

```
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: nginx_server
    volumes:
      - static_volume_app1:/usr/share/nginx/html/static_app1
      - media_volume_app1:/usr/share/nginx/html/media_app1
      - static_volume_app2:/usr/share/nginx/html/static_app2
      - media_volume_app2:/usr/share/nginx/html/media_app2
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt 
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
```

2. Run the docker-compose:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

3. access the nginx_container and install certbot and then exit it:

```
docker exec -it nginx_server /bin/sh
# apk add certbot certbot-nginx
# exit
```

4. install the certificate in the nginx server:

```
docker exec -it nginx_server certbot --nginx
```

you will go through a prompt to install the certificate for all the domains:

We recommend selecting either all domains, or all domains in a VirtualHost/server block.

Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/***.*****/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/***.*****/privkey.pem
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

Deploying certificate
Successfully deployed certificate for ***.***** to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Successfully deployed certificate for ***.***** to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Successfully deployed certificate for ***.***** to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Successfully deployed certificate for www.***.***** to /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://***.*****, https://***.*****, https://***.*****, and https://www.***.*****

NEXT STEPS:
- The certificate will need to be renewed before it expires. Certbot can automatically renew the certificate in the background, but you may need to take steps to enable that functionality. See https://certbot.org/renewal-setup for instructions.
